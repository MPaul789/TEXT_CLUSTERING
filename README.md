Used a dataset provided by Sklearn to have a replicable corpus. After that, we will use the KMeans algorithm to group the vectors generated by the TF-IDF. We will then use Principal Component Analysis to visualize our groups and bring out common or unusual characteristics of the texts present in our corpus.

Here is what weâ€™ll do

import the dataset
apply preprocessing to our corpus to remove words and symbols which, when converted into numerical format, do not add value to our model
use TF-IDF as a vectorization algorithm
apply KMeans to group our data
apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of our vectors to 2 for visualization purposes
interpret the data
